What is SFS-YOLO?
SFS-YOLO is an enhanced YOLOv11n-based detection architecture, specifically optimized for:

Low-light behavioral detection (e.g., dusk/night)

Small benthic species recognition (e.g., soldier crabs)

Ecological rhythm monitoring

Key Innovations:
SPD-Conv module: Preserves spatial features without stride loss
Fine-grained Channel Attention (FCA): Balances localâ€“global cues under variable lighting
SIoU loss function: Improves bounding box alignment via angular constraints
Lightweight model size (~4.8 MB) for real-time ecological deployment

Not all libraries in the requirements file need to be installed. The specific installation should be based on the requirements
